wtih below functionality:

 Display a grid of photos in your React app. Use the GET /photos endpoint from the Unsplash API to get a set of images.

 The grid must be responsive and adhere to the following layout:

2 columns on small size screens (< 720px)
3 columns on medium size screens (< 960px)
4 columns on large size screens (> 960px)
 On the bottom of the page, more images can be requested with a load more button. This results in more images being added to the grid.

 When the user taps on a photo on the grid it should show the full photo in a full width lightbox popup with more information about the photo.

 The lightbox popup should be dismissible with a close button.
